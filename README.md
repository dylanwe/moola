# Moola üí∏
Sometimes a product is a little expensive so you wait for the price to go down but you feel like you need to check it every day. Well, I've been buying a lot online recently and have come across this problem and I was looking to make a little project with Node.js and I think I can fix this problem with Node.
  
What I want to do is add a product to an excel sheet and set a price desired price for the product. When the product is that price or below it will send me an E-mail that says what product it is, what price it is, and a link to the product.
## How I made it üë®‚Äçüíª
Someone gave me the idea to get information out of an excel file.  
  
I chose to use Google Sheets because I can use it on every device where I log in so access is easy. I use [Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/) to turn my Google Sheet into an API that I can fetch with Node.js.  
In my sheet, I fill in a product name, desired price, and a link to the product.

With Node, I fetch the API and loop through the rows and scrape every link to find it's price.  
I then compare each product price to the desired price to check if the price is lower or equal, if that is true I add the product to my mail which will be sent with nodemailer at the end of my foreach loop. This whole process happens once a day on a server.
