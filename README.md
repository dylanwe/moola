Sometimes a product is a little expensive so you wait for the price to go down but you feel like you need to check it everyday. Well I've been buying a lot online recently and have come across this problem and I was looking to make a little project with Node.js and I think I can fix this problem with Node.  
  
What I want to do is add a product to an excell sheet and set a price desired price for the product. When the product is that price or below it will send me an E-mail that says what product it is, what price it is and a link to the product.
