Sometimes a product is a little expensive so you wait for the price to go down but you feel like you need to check it everyday. Well I've been buying a lot online recently and have come across this problem and I was looking to make a little project with Node.js and I think I can fix this problem with Node.  
  
What I want to do is add a product to an excell sheet and set a price desired price for the product. When the product is that price or below it will send me an E-mail that says what product it is, what price it is and a link to the product.
## How I made it
Someone gave me the idea to get infromation out of a excel file.  
I chose to use Google Sheets because I can use it on every device where I login so access is easy. I use [Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/) to turn my Google Sheet into a API that I can fetch with Node.js.
